# Leaf Project Analysis

## Overview
Leaf is a Rust-based Arrow file ingestion tool built with egui and DataFusion. It provides a GUI for importing CSV files, converting them to Apache Arrow format, and performing data transformations.

## Project Structure

### Entry Point (`src/main.rs`)
- Main entry point creates an egui application window
- Loads icon from `media/leaf.png`
- Window title: "Leaf - Arrow File Ingestion Tool"
- Has a test mode for delta null handling (`--test-delta` flag)

### Core Application (`src/app/state.rs`)
- `LeafApp` is the main application state struct
- Two modes: Viewer (read-only) and Builder (read/write)
- Manages:
  - Database connections (DataFusion context)
  - Query windows
  - Plot windows (to be removed)
  - Various dialogs (CSV import, duplicate detection, transformations, etc.)
  - Tables and views

### Core Functionality (`src/core/`)
- **database.rs**: DataFusion-based database operations, Arrow file I/O
- **csv_handler.rs**: CSV import/export functionality
- **duplicate_detector.rs**: Duplicate row detection
- **transformations.rs**: Data transformations (delta, time binning, row IDs)
- **time_grouping.rs**: Time-based data grouping
- **query.rs**: Query execution and result handling
- **error.rs**: Error handling types

### UI Components (`src/ui/`)
- **sidebar.rs**: Navigation sidebar for tables and actions
- **query_window.rs**: SQL query interface with minimum size constraints to prevent crashes
- **time_bin_dialog.rs**: Time binning functionality
- **theme.rs**: Leaf-themed green color scheme
- Various other dialogs for data operations

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Branding Updated
- Application renamed from "Fresh" to "Leaf" throughout
- Window title updated to "Leaf - Arrow File Ingestion Tool"
- Theme updated with leaf-inspired green color scheme
- Icon path updated to reference "leaf.png"

### 2. ✅ Plotting Functionality Removed
- Removed entire `plots/` directory (27 plot types)
- Removed `plot_window.rs` and `gpu_renderer.rs`
- Removed all plot-related code from query windows and app state

### 3. ✅ Duplicate Functionality Removed
- Removed `time_based_grouping.rs`
- Kept only `time_bin_dialog.rs` for time binning functionality

### 4. ✅ Window Resizing Crash Fixed
- Added minimum size constraints to query windows (300x200)
- Prevents egui layout assertion failures

### 5. ✅ Data Storage Location Fixed
- Transformed data now saves to the source data folder
- Removed hardcoded `transformed_data/` directory references
- Both transformations and time binning now use the database path

### 6. ✅ Removed transformed_data Folder
- Deleted the `transformed_data/` directory from the project

## Remaining Issue

### Row Count Accuracy
- The total row count display may need verification
- This requires runtime testing to confirm accuracy

## Current State & Optimizations Made

### 1. Code Organization
- Cleaned up imports and removed unused code
- `app/state.rs` reduced from 582 to ~510 lines
- Removed plot-related complexity throughout
  
### 2. Error Type Updated
- Renamed `FreshError` to `LeafError` for consistency
- Error handling remains functional throughout

### 3. Async Operations
- Removed GPU renderer and its async operations
- Simplified async handling

### 4. Build Warnings
- Several unused imports and variables (non-critical)
- Deprecated chrono methods that should be updated
- These can be addressed in future cleanup

### 5. File Operations
- Data now saves to appropriate directories
- Path handling improved with proper defaults

## Future Improvements

1. **Code Cleanup**
   - Address build warnings (unused imports, deprecated methods)
   - Remove dead code identified by compiler warnings
   - Update deprecated chrono timestamp methods

2. **Feature Enhancements**
   - Verify and fix row count accuracy
   - Add progress indicators for long-running operations
   - Consider adding data validation on import

3. **Code Quality**
   - Refactor remaining large modules
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Optimize database operations to reduce cloning

## Architecture Strengths
- Clean separation between core logic and UI
- Use of modern Rust patterns (Arc, Result types)
- DataFusion provides powerful query capabilities
- Modular dialog system for different operations
- Support for both read-only and read-write modes
- Consistent leaf-themed green UI

## Conclusion
The project has been successfully cleaned up and refocused as a pure Arrow file ingestion tool. All plotting functionality has been removed, branding has been updated to "Leaf", and the major issues have been resolved. The application now:
- Has a consistent "Leaf" branding with green theme
- Focuses solely on CSV to Arrow conversion
- Saves transformed data to the source directory
- Has proper window constraints to prevent crashes
- Builds successfully with only minor warnings

The core functionality is solid and the codebase is now more maintainable and focused on its primary purpose.
